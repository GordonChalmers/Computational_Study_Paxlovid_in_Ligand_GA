Chalmers G, Computational Study of Paxlovid in Ligand GA, 10.26434/chemrxiv-2022-p2phq
Submitted to Journal of Computer-Aided Molecular Design.


Calculations, docking results files, figures, and the paper are 
located at https://www.dropbox.com/sh/3vuza1s0gjmy1eo/AADLXPPe2Ve-N3RjMH3GoH5fa?dl=0     

Dropbox instead of GitHub is used because there is more space available for me in the Dropbox account.  

The Ligand GA software package is located at  https://github.com/GordonChalmers 

There are 3 directories:  calculations, figures, and proteins.  
The figures are made from mol2 files listed in READ_ME_figures.txt.  
The mol2 files are available in the calculations folder.  For convenience 
the mol2 files used in the figures are also in a sub-directory mol2_files_fig 
in the figures directory.  It is encouraged to look at the figures from the 
files in a molecular viewer.  The calculations folder contains docking results 
from the 2 steps in post-processing.  These sub-directories can also be used in 
grepping for various reasons in molecular analysis.  The files in using 
Ligand GA, .mat, prep, various other, are not in the download.  These are 
available upon request, and could be used to track evolution of individual 
molecules iteration by iteration (reconstruction of final molecules by process 
of mutation and crossover).  These files also have the results non-isomeric 
molecules with scores < 79 which didnâ€™t screen into the 76 non-isomeric 
molecules used here.
